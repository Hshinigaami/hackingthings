# Cloud

# What is cloud?
	- Cloud is the on-demand delivery of storage, database, computing power, applications and IT Services.
	- Pay as you go pricing.
	- Exact amount of storage and computing power.
	- Access servers instantly.

# What is server provisioning?
	- Setting up the server with all the configuration(Like OS Settings, Netowork, Computing resources).
	- Normally this would have been done with human interaction, but with cloud computing we can setup all this on the way.

# Public v/s Private cloud?
	## Public Cloud
		1. All users share the same number of resources and computing powers.
		2. Less secure compared to private cloud.
		3. Lower cost.

	## Private cloud
		1. Only specific users can access based on who is using the private one.
		2. Very much secure and can access all the resources. Security is due to servers are only placed behind customers firewall and not globally.
		3. High Cost.

# Hybrid Cloud
	1. This compose of public cloud(AWS, GOOGLE CLOUD, MICROSOFT AZURE) and Private cloud(Razorspace).
	2. We can have few resources in private section with security and some resources publicly available.

# Characteristics of Cloud Computing.
	1. On Demand services.
	2. Broad Network access
		a. Users can access the cloud from different networks.
	3. Multi-Tenancy and Resource pooling
		a. Access to same resources when users are connected to network.
	4. Rapid Elasticity and Scalability
		a. We can dispose or expand our resources on the way.
		b. Can scale hardware and infrastructure very easily.
	5. Measured services.
		a. Pay as per use policy.

# Different types of Cloud computing.
	1. IAAS(Infrastructure as a service): AWS will provide virutalization, servers, networking and storage.
	2. PAAS(Platform as a service): With above features, AWS Will also provide us OS, Middleware and Runtime.
	3. SAAS(Software as a service): With All of above features, AWS will give us applications and data as well.
