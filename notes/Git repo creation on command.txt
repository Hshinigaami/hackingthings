# Git repo creation on command line

1. create a new repository on the command line

echo "# Barker" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/hacknet/Barker.git
git push -u origin main

2. push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/hacknet/Barker.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

3. Since github has removed password authentication mechanism, we have to generate a PAT(Personal Access Token) to authenticate. For 2nd step to work, during authentication...username: hacknet and password: PAT
